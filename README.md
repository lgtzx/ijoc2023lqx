## Abstract
For an unbalanced cooperative game, its grand coalition can be stabilized by some instruments, such assubsidization and penalization, that impose new cost terms to certain coalitions. In this paper, we studyan alternative instrument, referred to as cost adjustment, that does not need to impose any new coalition specific cost terms. Specifically, our approach is to adjust existing cost coefficients of the game under which(i) the game becomes balanced so that the grand coalition becomes stable, (ii) a desired way of cooperation isoptimal for the grand coalition to adopt, and (iii) the total cost to be shared by the grand coalition is withina prescribed range. Focusing on a broad class of cooperative games, known as integer minimization games,we formulate the problem on how to optimize the cost adjustment as a constrained inverse optimizationproblem. We prove N P-hardness and derive easy-to-check feasibility conditions for the problem. Based ontwo linear programming reformulations, we develop two solution algorithms. One is a cutting-plane algorithm, which runs in polynomial time when the corresponding separation problem is polynomial time solvable. Theother needs to explicitly derive all the inequalities of a linear program, which runs in polynomial time whenthe linear program contains only a polynomial number of inequalities. We apply our models and solutionalgorithms to two typical unbalanced games, including a weighted matching game and an uncapacitatedfacility location game, showing that their optimal cost adjustments can be obtained in polynomial time.

## Instances and results

We consider two specific test instances of CIOP, called WMG and UFL, which can be found in the folders "WMG" and "UFL", respectively. The specific descriptions of the instances can be found in the file "Data Format Description.txt" in each folder for the two classes of instances. The methods are coded in Matlab. The source files can be found in the subfolders "WMG/src" and "UFL/src", respectively. Guidance for implementation can be found in the files "WMG/README_WMG.pdf" and "UFL/README_UFL.pdf", respectively. Meanwhile, the results of the two specific instances are available in the folders "WMG/results" and "UFL/results". Each folder contains a "summary" subfolder, which includes files named "TableX.txt". These four files correspond to the statistical metrics in four tables presented in the paper's Section 4.3. Note that to run the source code for the UFL instances in the folder "UFL/src", a license for Gurobi should be downloaded.
